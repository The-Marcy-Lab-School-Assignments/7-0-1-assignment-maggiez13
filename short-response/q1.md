# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts? 

# Answer
`useEffect` accepts a callback function and an optional dependency array. 

The callback function contains the logic to run after the component renders. The callback can create an async function (such as `doFetch`) that handles tasks like fetching data and updating state based on the response. 

An optional dependency array determines when the effect should re-run: an empty array runs the effect only once after the initial render, a populated array re-runs the effect when the dependencies change, and no array causes the effect to run after every render. 

`useEffect` executes the effect when the component renders and re-renders.
